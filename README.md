# 8-bit-car-racing
Source code for an implementation of a classic, traffic dodging game.

This implementation will only run on Turbo C++ and is not supported by modern C++ compilers like Borland C++.
That's because it uses some antiquated C graphics libraries that are not a part of the default compiler package these days.
